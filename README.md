# IPM 2018 Prototype "TriPlaner"

The goal of `TriPlaner` is to create a platform to streamline the process of creating travel plans.
## Code Structure

* __carousel-slider.html__  - Home screen for signed users.
* __index.html__ - Home screen for the unsigned users. First thing a user sees.
* __login.html__ - The login screen.
* __mix-style.html__ - Feed. The feed is always "Culture", because it's just a prototype and everything is hardcoded in the html.
* __register.html__ - The register screen
* __single-blog.html__ - View of a single itinerary.
* __tag.html__ - The profile of a user screen.
